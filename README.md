# Team Profile Generator

## Description
This project will generate an HTML webpage, using using a Node.js command-line application, to create a team profile with employee information. A user will be prompted to enter a manager's name, ID number, email, and office number. Then they will have a choice to enter an engineer, intern, or finish building the team. The engineer's info includes their name, ID number, email, and GitHub username. The intern's info will include their name, ID number, email, and school name. Clicking on any of the email addresses will open up an email to send to the displayed address. Clicking on the GitHub username will open up the GitHub profile in a new tab. When the team is finished being built, the HTML will be generated. The four tests for employee, engineer, manager, and intern must pass.

## Installation
In the code editor, select the folder to use and open the Integrated Terminal (or GitBash). From there run `npm init`, followed by `npm i inquirer`, and `npm i jest -D`. The application can then be started by entering the command `node index.js`. The tests can be run by entering `npm test`.
